To start this analysis the first task was to identify communities within the network. Since the network is relatively large with 31,304 nodes, we use the Louvain method for community detection as it performs well on large datasets and is shown that it has a very good accuracy in terms of decomposing the network in communities that have a modularity close to the optimal one.</p><p>The algorithm follows a greedy optimization approach for finding communities. It initially identifies small communities by optimizing modularity locally for all nodes. Each of these small communities is then treated as a single unit and the algorithm is repeated until a certain threshold of gain in modularity is exceeded. Using the algorithm on our network, we find around 80 communities and a total modularity of around 0.52, indicating that the algorithm finds somewhat meaningful communities.
However, out of the total number of communities, only a few of them are large (around 5) and contain nodes in the thousands. There are also some smaller communities with nodes in the hundreds, and lastly, many very small communities that have nodes ranging from around 2 to 10. For further analysis, we will focus on the top 10 largest communities.
Taking a closer look at some of the largest communities, we can explore if it is possible to identify different fields within the network based on the packages alone. The following lists the 10 “most important” packages within the three largest communities based on their total degree count:</p><ol><li><strong>numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, tqdm, pillow, scikit-learn, pip, torch, python</strong></li><li><strong>pytest, pytest-cov, coverage, flake8, twine, setuptools, black, sphinx, wheel, mypy</strong></li><li><strong>requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml, aiohttp, plotly, bokeh, selenium, bs4, mpld3, docopt</strong></li></ol><p>Looking at these packages, it appears that the communities formed indeed relates to different subfields within programming. For example, the first community seems to be centered around scientific computing and machine learning, with packages like <em>numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn, and torch</em>. The second community seems to be focused on testing and code quality, with packages like <em>pytest, pytest-cov, coverage, flake8, and mypy</em>. The third community seems to be related to web scraping and web development, with packages like <em>requests, click, beautifulsoup4, and lxml</em>.</p><p>To try to obtain a deeper understanding of each community, we conducted a textual analysis of the packages’ README files using TF-IDF. By analyzing the words used in these files, we can gain further knowledge about what the packages in the communities are typically used for. The first step was to tokenize the text by removing any stopwords, punctuation, and stemming the words across all the README files. Additionally, collocations were made to also consider the possibilty of combined words. These were then used in the analysis where the top TF-IDF words for each community was computed. To visualize the results, word clouds of the biggest 10 communities with their TF-IDF words where created. In the following plot the word cloud for the largest community along with a listing of the top 3 packages within the community based on the degree can be seen. Similar word cloud plots for the rest of the top 10 communities can be seen in the <a href=explainer-notebook.html>explainer notebook</a> or one of the repositories.</p><img src=../images/Community_0.0.png width=800><p>In general, these word clouds show some mixed results. First of all, it can be seen that many of the TF-IDF words found are fairly generic and not really domain-specific, meaning that they don’t help uncover what a specific community is about. This is probably due to the fact that README files in general contain a lot of boilerplate text that is common across many Python projects, such as installation instructions, contribution guidelines, and licensing information, which is not necessarily relevant to the programming domain of the package. Furthermore, some of the words in the different word clouds can be a bit hard to interpret since the words are stemmed.</p><p>On the other hand, we do see some words that can be more domain-specific. For instance, in this community, words like &lsquo;AI&rsquo;, &lsquo;alert&rsquo;, &lsquo;pixel&rsquo;, and &lsquo;databa&rsquo; suggest that this community has to something to do with subfileds such as machine learning, data visualization, and perhaps database management. When considering the top packages for this community <em>pandas</em>, <em>matplotlib</em>, and <em>numpy</em>, this allign reasonably well.
Despite these alignments, the overall effectiveness of the TF-IDF analysis in finding community boundaries based on README content alone appears limited. The method&rsquo;s inherent sensitivity to document frequency may put too much emphasis on common but uninformative terms, while the significance of more telling keywords could be overseen. This suggests that while TF-IDF can uncover some patterns, it could potentionally be improved by incorporating an alternative stemmer or stopwords library more catered towards coding terms and jargon.</p><hr class="border-b-2 border-gray-400 mt-8 mx-4"><div class="font-sans flex justify-between content-center px-4 pb-12"><div class=text-left><p><a href=../network-analysis class="break-normal text-base md:text-sm text-green-500 font-bold no-underline hover:underline">&lt;
